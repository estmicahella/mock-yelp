## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5 & CSS3

Using Yelp's website as a reference, I started with coding the content with HTML5 then styled from header to footer with CSS3. For media queries, I referred to the dimensions of 1025px+ for desktop. As for tablet, 768px-1024px and for mobile, 767px-.

## Lessons Learned:

The content decisions for the media queries became the most challenging, though I learned how to stack elements well for both tablet and mobile.
